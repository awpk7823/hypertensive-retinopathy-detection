Step 1. Segment arteries and veins from the test image - 

For this run the build_predictions file present in HR_GUI folder. The images to be segmented has to be put in the retinal_images folder present in the HR_GUI folder. The resuls will be stored in the uncertaininty folder present in results folder which is present in HR_GUI folder. Results will be of same filename as that of test images but will have png extension. 

Step 2. ROI detection - 

For this run the roicode file present in HR_GUI folder. In this file give the path of image to be segmented. Save the results(.jpg format) in the mask folder present in HR_GUI folder. 

NOTE: filename of original, segmented and mask image should be same. Format of original and mask image is .jpg and format of segmented image is .png.

Step 3. Now run the GUI - 

For this goto to anaconda prompt and go to the location where manage.py file is there. Then type the command:

python manage.py runserver

Now goto this URL : http://127.0.0.1:8000/home

Step 4. Goto prediction tab, and browse for image to be tested that should be present in retinal_images folder. Then click SUBMIT.
